		<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.17</h1> 
		
		<h2>1598: Add support for Visual Studio 2010</h2> <p>Test runner, code coverage and 'Go To Reflector' functionality now works with Visual Studio 2010/.NET 4.0.</p> 

		<h2>1593: Add support for Silverlight 2.0 RTM</h2> <p>Use 'Test With &gt; Silverlight' to execute public ad-hoc tests with the Silverlight CoreCLR. This feature is compatible with Silverlight 2.0 RTM and Beta versions.</p> 
		
		<h2>1599: Execute tests in namespace using 'Solution Explorer' folder</h2> <p>When all classes in a solution folder belong to the same namespace, TestDriven.Net will execute all tests in the namespace as a single test run rather than as individual test fixtures.</p>
	
		<h2>1592: Save keyboard shortcuts</h2> <p>Preserve keyboard shortcuts when new version of TestDriven.Net is installed. This will work when updating TestDriven.Net 2.17 and higher.</p> 

		<h2>1595: Add options pane to view test runners</h2> <p>You can view installed test runners under 'Tools &gt; Options... &gt; TestDriven.Net &gt; Test Runners'. A future version will allow you to enable/disable them.</p> 

		<h2>1590: Look for unit testing framework assembly in target directory and/or target assembly references</h2> <p>This better supports extensible test frameworks like MbUnit or xUnit where their framework assembly ('MbUnit.Framework' or 'xunit') isn't necessarily referenced directly by the test assembly.</p> 
	</div>
	  

	<div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">
		<H1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.16</H1> 
			 
		 <H2>1585: Add support for test categories</H2> <P>Categories of test can be included or excluded via the TestDriven.Net options pane (this feature works for NUnit tests).</P> 
	
		 <H2>1580: Add &#39;Go To Reflector&#39; support for F#</H2> <P>&#39;Go To Reflector&#39; now works on F# projects, modules, parameterless methods and properties.</P> 

		 <H2>1581: Add support for executing parameterless F# methods</H2> <P>F# methods can be executed as ad-hoc tests or via a unit testing framework that supports static test methods (e.g. xUnit).</P> 
		
		 <H2>1582: Add support for evaluating F# properties</H2> <P>You can now use &#39;Run Test(s)&#39; on F# properties to evaluate them.</P> 
			
		 <H2>1587: Always display console output/error and test runner messages</H2> <P>Test runner generated messages and console output will now be displayed when running all tests in a project/solution.</P> 
		
		 <H2>1588: Optionally display trace/debug output when running all tests in project/solution</H2> <P>By default trace/debug output isn&#39;t displayed when executing all tests in a project/solution. This behaviour can be modified via the TesDriven.Net options pane.</P>
		 
		 <H2>1586: Add support for test runners that aren&#39;t hosted in a new app domain</H2> <P>This is a new extensibility point for test runners that want to manage their own test process/app domain (future versions of Gallio will use this).</P>

			<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.14</h1> 
									
			<h2>1381: Add support for Silverlight 2 Beta 2</h2> <p>'Test With &gt; Silverlight' now supports Silverlight 2 Beta 2.</p> 
			
			<h2>1388: 'Test With &gt; Team Coverage' isn't visible in VS2008 Team Edition</h2> <p>Team Coverage is now supported on a clean VS2008 Team Edition install.</p> 
			
			<h2>1390: Honour the solution 'Configuration Manager' project 'Build' settings</h2> <p>When
			running all tests in a solution, only projects with 'Build' checked in
			the 'Configuration Manager' will be built and executed.</p> 

			<h2>1344: Add support for Gallio's "Icarus" GUI</h2> <p>When Gallio is installed, 'Test With &gt; Gallio Icarus' should appear on project context menu.</p> 
			
			<h2>1379: Run all tests in Solution not working with Solution Folders</h2> <p>Tests in solution folders will now be executed.</p> 
	</div>


	<div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">
			 <h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.13</h1> 
	
			 <h2>1341: Add support for Silverlight 2 Beta 1</h2> <p>Running 'ad-hoc' public methods now works with Silverlight 2.0 Beta 1.</p> 
			
			 <h2>1342: Add support for NUnit 2.4.7</h2> <p>Updated NUnit test runner to target NUnit 2.4.7.</p> 
			
			 <h2>1343: Include NUnit RowTest Extension in package</h2> <p>Andreas Schlapsi's RowTest for NUnit can be found in the '\Program Files\TestDriven.NET 2.0\NUnit\2.4\nunit.framework.extensions.dll' assembly.</p> 
			
			 <h2>1268: Replace Orcas with VS2008 in setup features dialog</h2> <p>Made it clear that TestDriven.Net works with VS 2008 in the installer.</p> 
	</div>
							

	   <div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">
			 <h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.12</h1> 
			
					 <h2>1197: Treat “do not build” as “do not test”</h2> <p>When running all tests in a solution, honor the 'Build' check box in the 'Configuration Manager'.</p> 
					
					 <h2>1198: Workaround for C++ assemblies remaining locked</h2> <p>There
appears to be a bug when mixed managed/unmanaged C++ assemblies are
unloaded that causes them to remain locked. As a workaround you can add
the following to your App.config file's appSettings element: &lt;add
key="ShadowCopyFiles" value="true" /&gt;</p> 
					
					 <h2>1200: Update to use NUnit 2.4.6</h2> <p>NUnit 2.4.6 is now packaged with TestDriven.Net (remember to update any installed NUnit add-ins).</p> 
					
					 <h2>1199: Improve support for "Smart Build"</h2> <p>This
version should correctly determine when a build is required before a
test run. The previous version might incorrectly skip the build if only
a non-source project item had changed. The 'Smart Build' feature is now
only active when using VS 2005 and above.</p>
           </div>



	   <div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">

			
				<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.11</h1>
					
								<h2>1168: Add support for NUnit 2.4 parameterized test methods</h2>
								<p>You
can now target for execution NUnit test methods that take parameters
(e.g. when using Andreas Schlapsi's RowTestExtension for NUnit).</p>

								<h2>1166: Add support for VS SDK TestHostFramework when using 'Test With &gt; In-Proc'</h2>
								<p>When
using 'Test With &gt; In-Proc' the 'Dte' and 'ServiceProvider'
properties of 'VsIdeTestHostContext' will be available for use. For
this to work the Visual Studio 2007 SDK must be installed and a
reference to 'Microsoft.VSSDK.TestHostFramework' added.</p>
						
								<h2>1167: 'Test With &gt; NUnit 2.4' takes a long time to launch NUnit GUI</h2>
								<p>This
was caused by an obscure log4net related issue. I've implemented a
workaround to avoid the delay and ensure that NUnit log files are
written to the correct location ('%APPDATA%\NUnit\NUnit.log').</p>
						
								<h2>1161: NUnit extensions aren't being loaded when placed in '%ProgramFiles%\TestDriven.NET 2.0\NUnit\2.4\addins' directory</h2>
								<p>The 'addins' directory must only contain valid assembly files. I've moved the 'addins.txt' file into the parent directory.</p>
						
								<h2>1165: 'Go To Reflector' on 'Call Stack' can mix up generic and non-generic methods</h2>
								<p>This
command should no longer mix up generic and non-generic implementations
of a method (e.g. 'Method&lt;T&gt;(T x)' and 'Method(int x)').</p>
						
						
		
		</div>



	   <div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">

			
				<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.10.2173</h1>
					
								<h2>1159: Improve 'Go To Reflector' support on 'Call Stack' tool window</h2>
								<p>Added
support for generic methods, generic types, overloaded methods,
constructors, properties and explicitly implemented interfaces. This
has been tested using C# and Visual Basic (with and without debug
symbols).</p>
						
								<h2>1160: Can't 'Toggle Breakpoint' on constructor method from inside Reflector.</h2>
								<p>You
can now toggle breakpoints on regular constructors from inside
Reflector. Unfortunately Visual Studio doesn't appear to support
setting breakpoints on static constructors by method name.</p>
						
		</div>
		
		
	   <div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">

				<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.10</h1>
				
								<h2>1140: Add 'Go To Reflector' support for generics</h2>
								<p>Generic
types, methods and other members are now supported when using 'Go To
Reflector' and 'Go To Source code' (from inside .NET Reflector).</p>

								<h2>1147: Skip build check if there are no changes</h2>
								<p>If
no source files have been edited since the last test run, assume that a
build won't be required before the next run. This leads to a
significant performance improvement when dealing with large solutions.<br></p>

								<h2>1150: Add support for VS 2008 'Test With... Team Coverage'</h2>
								<p>'Test With... Team Coverage' option is now available when using VS 2008 Team Suite/Tester/Developer.</p>
				
								<h2>1133: NCover 2.0 x64 Support</h2>
								<p>NCover 2.0 (64-bit) will now be detected and used when testing a 64-bit (or platform neutral) assembly.</p>
								
								<h2>1145: Add support for 64-bit versions of NCover 2.0 and TypeMock</h2>
								<p>TestDriven.Net will now use 64-bit versions of NCover and TypeMock when installed.</p>
					
								<h2>1005: NCover 2.0 project name support</h2>
								<p>TestDriven.Net will pass the name of the current solution to NCover 2.0 for use with NCoverExplorer's per "project" settings.</p>
						
								<h2>1125: Support for generic unit tests</h2>
								<p>Targeting
generic test types and methods is now supported. The usefulness of this
will depend on the individual unit testing frameworks.</p>
						
								<h2>1152: Update to use NUnit 2.4.5</h2>
								<p>This version of NUnit is significantly faster, especially when running a small number of tests.</p>
												
								<h2>1149: VS 2008 crashes on startup when 'Code Analysis Tools' feature is not installed</h2>
								<p>This appears to be a bug in the VS 2008 CommandBars automation model. I've implemented a workaround
								in this version that should avoid the crash.</p>
						
								<h2>1141: Uninstalling TypeMock breaks 'Test With... Coverage'</h2>
								<p>In
some versions of TypeMock, the TypeMock add-in was being left behind on
uninstall. This orphaned add-in would cause 'Test With... Coverage' to
break. I've added a check for this and a warning message.</p>
						
								<h2>1143: TMockRunner is being used even when TypeMock is dissabled</h2>
								<p>Don't use TMockRunner with NCover if TypeMock is disabled.</p>
		</div> 



		<div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">
			<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.9</h1>
			
			<h2>1062: Update for Silverlight 1.1 Alpha September Refresh</h2>
			<p>Updated CLSID and fixed timing issue so Test With Silverlight now works with September refresh.</p>
			
			<h2>1063: Add support for running NCover 2.0 when TypeMock is enabled</h2>
			<p>Fixed so that code coverage with NCover 2.0 works when the TypeMock add-in is enabled in Visual Studio.</p>
			
			<h2>1118: Update to use NUnit 2.4.2</h2>
			<p>NUnit 2.4.2 is now included in the installer.</p>
			
			<h2>1041: Call to System.Windows.Forms.Application.CommonAppDataPath fails in DebugMode</h2>
			<p>Fixed issue that would cause tests that use Application.CommonAppDataPath to fail.</p>
		</div>		

		<div id="FogBugzReleaseNotes">
				<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.8</h1>
				<h2>993: Retire Visual Studio Express support</h2>
				<p>See joint statement: &quot;Jamie Cansdale and Microsoft Corporation have agreed to concentrate on working together on future releases of TestDriven.Net for Microsoft's officially extensible editions of Visual Studio, as opposed to spending time litigating their differences.&quot;</p>
				
				<h2>995: DirectoryNotFoundException is thrown on paths that contains non ASCII characters</h2>
				<p>This issue was only manifesting on machines running non-English versions of Windows.</p>

				<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.7</h1>
								
								<h2>956: Add support for 'Test With... Silverlight'</h2>
								<p>When
Silverlight 1.1 is installed a new 'Test With... Silverlight' option
will appear on the code context menu.&nbsp; This enables the execution
of any public method using the CoreCLR (similar the existing ad-hoc
tests feature). At the moment no unit testing frameworks are compatible
with the CoreCLR.</p>
						
								<h2>962: Include NUnit 2.4.1</h2>
								<p>See release notes <a href="http://nunit.com/index.php?p=releaseNotes&amp;r=2.4.1">here</a></p>
						
								<h2>945: NUnit 2.4 extensions aren't working</h2>
								<p>To
use NUnit extensions with TestDriven.NET you must place extension
assemblies in the '\Program Files\TestDriven.NET 2.0\NUnit\2.4\addins'
directory.</p>
						
								<h2>961: Exceptions in TestFixtureSetUp/TearDown not shown</h2>
								<p>Exception information was not being displayed when using new NUnit 2.4 version. This is now fixed.</p>
								
								<h2>967: Bug when running NUnit tests with '#' in path</h2>
								<p>Test assembly path was being truncated when directory contained a '#'. This is now fixed.</p>
								
								<h2>966: Problems with XNA tests (working directory issues)</h2>
								<p>See <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2007/05/18/using-testdriven-net-with-xna-game-studio-express.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pixelpilot.dk/Testdriven.htm">here</a> for workaround.</p>

								<p>Include new build of NCover in package.</p>					
						
								<h2>943: "Test With... Coverage" Hangs</h2>
								<p>Fixed
bug where "Test With... Coverage" would hang if there were too many
assemblies with PDB information referenced by a project.</p>
						
								<h2>945: NUnit 2.4 extensions aren't working</h2>
								<p>In
this version you must create a directory at '\Program
Files\TestDriven.NET 2.0\addins' for NUnit extensions (this is a
temporary solution).</p>
						
								<h2>950: Ignored tests displayed as errors in task/error list</h2>
								<p>Assert.Ignore(...) now shows up correctly as a warning in&nbsp; Error List.</p>

				<h1>Release Notes - TestDriven.NET: 2.0 RTM</h1>
					
								<h2>772: Can't run ad-hoc tests in NUnit project</h2>
								<p>Stopped 'No fixture attribute on parent class' warning when executing a non-test method in NUnit test project.</p>
						
								<h2>317: Run Test(s) not working - Private NUnit fixtures</h2>
								<p>Warn
when attempting to run a private test fixture or test. Before the test
would be executed as an ad-hoc test without any setup/teardown methods
being called.</p>
						
								<h2>567: Install TestDriven.NET for all users when runnign as Administrator</h2>
								<p>When running as user in Administrator role, install for all users rather than just current user. This fixes installing on Vista.</p>
						
								<h2>569: Ship NCover with TestDriven.NET</h2>
								<p>NCover
is now shipped as part of the TestDriven.NET installer. NCover 1.3.3
and 1.5.6 are included. NCover 1.5 will be used if .NET 2.0 is
installed (works with Visual Studio 2002, 2003 and 2005). NCover 1.3
will be used if only .NET 1.1 is installed. Thanks to Peter Waldschmidt
for allowing me to ship a non-GPL version of NCover with TestDriven.NET!</p>
						
								<h2>153: Add option to build and test with .NET 1.1/MSBee when using VS2005</h2>

								<h2>275: Exceptions in test fixture setup/teardown not reported</h2>
								<p>Output any exceptions thrown in fixture SetUp/TearDown.</p>
						
								<h2>619: Add 'Repeat Test Run' to Solution Explorer menus</h2>
								<p>Made all menus with unit testing functionality consistent.</p>
						
								<h2>629: Activate 'Test' pane at end of run</h2>
								<p>Activate the 'Test' pane at the end of a test run so test results are visible after 'Test With... Debugger'.</p>
						
								<h2>637: Output window is activated on test run in VS2003 but not VS2005</h2>
								<p>Always
make output window visible on test run unless window is set to auto
hide. Use 'Projects and Solutions\Show Output window when build starts'
option if you want 'Output' window to pop up when set to auto hide.</p>
						
								<h2>647: Warn when no test runner is found to run test(s)</h2>
								<p>Added warning when attempting to run a fixture with attributes from an unknown/not-installed unit testing framework.</p>
						
								<h2>697: Add an easy way to switch between NCover and Team Coverage</h2>
								<p>Show NCover 'Coverage' and 'Team Coverage' options on the 'Test With' menus when code coverage tools are available for use.</p>
						
								<h2>701: Only show menu items for available test runners</h2>
								<p>Only
show test runners on 'Test With' menus that are available to use use
(i.e. appropriate applications are installed). For example NCover, Team
Coverage, TypeMock and .NET 1.1 (MSBee) will only appear when available
for use.</p>
						
								<h2>704: Enable unmanaged code debugging</h2>
								<p>Added
support for mixed mode and unmanaged debugging. 'Test With... Debugger'
will use the 'Enable unmanaged code debugging' or 'Debugger Type'
settings for the test project. The C++ debugger type 'Auto'&nbsp; will
always default to managed.</p>
						
								<h2>705: Add (hidden) support for 'Test With... E&amp;C'</h2>
								<p>To
enable 'Test With... Debugger (E&amp;C)' that works with Edit &amp;
Continue; edit the 'TestDriven.dll.config' file and uncomment
&lt;button command="DebuggerEaC" /&gt;. This test runner may 'touch'
project files when used with source control (this is why it's disabled
by default).</p>

								<p>An appropriate warning will be output when the 'App.config' file of a test project contains invalid XML.</p>
						
								<h2>716: Add Reflector to Tools menu</h2>
								<p>Added
'Go To Reflector' button to Tools menu. Select a solution or project in
the 'Solution Explorer' and hit 'Tools\Go To Reflector' to load project
assemblies into Reflector. 'Go To Reflector' can be used from many
different window contexts.</p>
						
								<h2>717: Show Breakpoints Tool Window on Reflector 'Toogle Breakpoint'</h2>
								<p>Show breakpoints when a breakpoint is toggled from inside Reflector (right click on a method and 'Toggle Breakpoint').</p>
						
								<h2>720: Add 'Go To Reflector' option to 'Modules' window </h2>
								<p>One or more modules can be selected inside the debugger 'Modules' window and opened inside Reflector.</p>

								<p>One of more project references can be selected and opened inside Reflector.</p>
						
								<h2>724: Allow property get to method to be executed as ad-hoc test</h2>
								<p>Property get methods can now be executed as ad-hoc tests.</p>
						
								<h2>737: Testing a folder's worth of test fixtures</h2>
								<p>Run
each test fixture in the folder as a separate test run rather than
assuming the folder exactly corresponds to a namespace. Only the first
class in each source file will be executed as a fixture.</p>
						
								<h2>661: Rename 'Test With...' to simply 'Test With'</h2>
								<p>Changed to conform with menu naming conventions.</p>
						
								<h2>670: Use installed NCover unless packaged version is newer</h2>
								<p>Give priority to installed versions of NCover that are newer than the built in version.</p>

support for testing with code coverage when TypeMock is enabled. Simply
use 'Test With... Coverage' when the TypeMock add-in is enabled.</p>
						
								<h2>694: Tests not running in 64 bit mode</h2>
								<p>Honor
'x86', 'x64' or 'Itanium' platform setting of test project. If platform
is set to 'Any CPU' then tests will default to running in 64 bit
process.</p>
						
								<h2>695: Add 'Test With... TypeMock' support</h2>
								<p>Added
option to 'Test With... TypeMock'. This allows TypeMock to only be used
on tests that require it (when the TypeMock add-in is disabled). Tests
that don't require TypeMock run faster when TypeMock is disabled.</p>
						
								<h2>276: Problem with 'Test With...Debugger' + SourceGear Vault in VS.NET 2005</h2>
								<p>Use
much faster 'Test With... Debugger' functionality when running under
Visual Studio 2005 that doesn't touch project files and interfere with
source control.</p>
						
								<h2>590: TestDriven.NET 1.0 and TestDriven.NET 2.0 GUID/ProgID</h2>
								<p>Made
more robust when faced with possible left over registry entries from
previous installs (e.g if an uninstall was forced using msizap).</p>
						
								<h2>605: Test With Coverage fails when running as non-admin</h2>
								<p>'Team
Coverage' test runner is only available when running as Administrator
user. NCover 'Coverage' test runner will work when running as Limited
User.</p>
						
								<h2>652: Go To Reflector problems (proxy config and loading service)</h2>
								<p>Preserve
important Reflector configuration settings when using an already
installed version of Reflector. Use proper download dialog to obtain
Reflector on first use. Thanks to Grant Drake for contributing this
feature!</p>
						
								<h2>653: Old TestDriven.NET 1.0 menus remain in VS2005</h2>
								<p>Remove any menus that might be left over from previous versions of TestDriven.NET.</p>
						
								<h2>640: Assemblies in Reflector aren't reloaded after build</h2>
								<p>Reload assemblies when 'Go To Reflector' is called if the assembly has changed.</p>
						
								<h2>636: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host</h2>

								<h2>696: Repeat Test Run with Debugger building wrong assemblies</h2>
								<p>Fixed issue where 'Repeat Test Run' would build wrong assemblies when testing with debugger on Visual Studio 2002/2003.</p>
						
								<h2>693: Requested Service not found</h2>
